# Deep learning Based Parkinson's Disease Prediction

Parkinson's Disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease first described by James Parkinson. It is one of the common cause of neurological illness among older adults affecting about 1% of the population over 60years old. 50% more men than women get this disease.

It is caused when nerve cells(Neurons) in an area of the brain called substantia nigra becomes impaired or die. These cells produce dopamine and leads to range of motor and cognitive symptoms. Prediction of this disease is challenging as its symptoms are very similar to other disease like normal ageing, tremor, slowness of movement and stiff muscles. Due to this reason 25% of inaccurate manual diagnosis of parkinson's disease occurs. 

Aim of this project is to build a model using CNN/ Pretrained model network which will accurately classify Parkinson's Disease and Normal Patients.
